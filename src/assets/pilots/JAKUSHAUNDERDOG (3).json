Their father, the anchor of their unit, had been murdered under mysterious circumstances.

A crime left unanswered, a wound left unhealed.

A transgression left unavenged.

The truth is paramount and success is the key. The siblings were enrolled in the prestigious Seimei Sen'i Academy, bankrolled by the Union seeing their potential. In the academy, piloting mechs wasn't a curriculum but a path to survival and power.

Though the other sibling quickly rose through the ranks and fame as a prodigy, Koryu carried a fiercer determination. He vowed not merely to match their expectations but to surpass it.

To become the greatest pilot the galaxy had ever known.

That race between them was more than a rivalry; it was destiny pulling at each other's strings to see who'd break first. And in the heart of it all, the core of Koryu's will to uncover their father's killer, no matter the cost.
