Footage of a fight of hers would circulate the Omninet and quickly cascade into talkshow appearances, guest cameos and a massive place in online culture. She would always carry this frank and stoic persona, a mask that would only ever slip around her daughter.</p><p>Abigail Rahne was born to much fanfare. Her father was never revealed to the public but a divorce quickly followed her birth. Lancer and celebrity money would give her an incredibly privileged upbringing with servants and private tutoring. Ellem would rarely be in Abby's life but she showed an incredibly compassionate and motherly side when she did. Still, it would be difficult for Abby not to carry some resentment within her for the mother she never got to see.</p><p>It would worsen when her mother disappeared during a mission she was sent on by Union. News sources would comment on how heartless she was, to not grieve her own mother's death. The rumors would keep spreading as she began privately learning mech piloting. Eventually, she'd apply for a Lancer License and pass at just the age of 20. Word would spread that she was 'eschewing' her mother's fighting style for a less flashy 'weaker' style centred around infiltrating opponent's systems.<br><br>She tries not to let it get to her.</p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":6,"background":"Celebrity","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"c9baf0b8-8441-4a9e-af56-60fc9ed7461e","name":"Remele","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_chomolungma","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":0,"current_hp":12,"overshield":0,"current_stress":4,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":4,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Tue Apr 22 2025 04:10:21 GMT+0800 (Singapore Standard Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"https://i.imgur.com/R6YDVQ4.png","loadouts":[{"id":"7c2d0043-a151-4807-9604-619701b6109e","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_turret_drones","uses":3,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"The use of turret drones is a rather traditional form of force multiplication – one that has remained the backbone of defense in many theaters."},{"id":"ms_manipulators","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"Precise interaction with built and natural environments, soft targets, and hazardous materials is part of the daily routine for support-class mechs.
