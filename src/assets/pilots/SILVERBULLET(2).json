He doesnt remember them, assuming they are dead. His life had been nothing but training, turning him into a pilot, a hound. For many years he worked under a handler who seemed immortal, constantly healing from fatal wounds. Silvers bio-tag kept him bound. Escape was impossible.</p><p>On one ordinary day, as the handlers back was turned, Silver saw a bullet on the table. Something whispered to him, a cold certainty. He knew it would work. Without hesitation, he picked up the gun, loaded the bullet, and shot his handler.</p><p>The handler fell to the ground like a hunk of meat, dead.</p><p>Silver walked away, leaving his number behind, and took the name Jack Vesper, callsign Silver Bullet. Free, he became a mercenary, living for himself, robbing, drugs, chasing women, easy going with no morals to speak of.</p><p>He kept the bullet as a memory, always close, never suspecting that a far more terrifying force held him captive now.</p>","quirks":[],"current_hp":10,"background":"Super Soldier","resistances":[],"mechs":[{"id":"2c141082-6e4f-484e-84ed-40028037aec7","name":"Heat Abnormal","notes":"","gm_note":"","frame":"mf_standard_pattern_i_everest","active":false,"current_structure":4,"current_move":4,"boost":4,"current_hp":11,"overshield":0,"current_stress":0,"current_heat":0,"current_repairs":5,"current_overcharge":0,"current_core_energy":1,"statuses":[],"conditions":[],"resistances":[],"reactions":[],"burn":0,"destroyed":false,"defeat":"","activations":1,"meltdown_imminent":false,"reactor_destroyed":false,"core_active":false,"cc_ver":"ERR","lastModified":"Sun Apr 27 2025 19:12:30 GMT+0200 (Central European Summer Time)","isDeleted":false,"expireTime":"","deleteTime":"","portrait":"","cloud_portrait":"https://i.imgur.com/79cx1lb.png","loadouts":[{"id":"7f792ca0-b237-44d4-9c3e-87b14338eb74","name":"Primary","systems":[{"id":"ms_type_3_projected_shield","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"The GMS Type-3 Projected Shield traps and denies incoming projectiles by projecting an aggressive, superpositional anti-ballistic barrier."},{"id":"ms_rapid_burst_jump_jet_system","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":""},{"id":"ms_beckoner","uses":0,"destroyed":false,"cascading":false,"flavorName":"","flavorDescription":"“I am heard in the House of Stillness; I am clad in the Magick of RA.
