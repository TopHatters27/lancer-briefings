As the squad nears FOB Saber, they happen upon the train depot that held the most direct route. Visual scans say that a train car with a mechanized chassis outfitted with missile launchers was in the depot.

Another Union dropship, 'Foehammer', flies overhead ***HULLBREAKER*** and radios in requesting coordinates as they were sent from the UNS Rio Grande to act as reinforcements. Although 'Foehammer' made it further than the first wave did and with no way to pierce through communications jamming, ***HULLBREAKER*** can only watch as they are struck down by a salvo of missiles.

1st Lt. ***ALEX KIM*** through garbled vocal comms and jumbled text messages, re-tasks the squad to destroy enemy Anti-Air defences.

The squad elected to take the alternative route that flanks the enemy forces at the train depot. ***Remele*** suggests using hit-and-run tactics, using smoke to act as a screen whilst ***Silver Bullet*** and ***Underdog*** will strike hard and fast, killing the enemy mech that is acting as an anti-air battery, 'Rainmaker'.

Although successful at the early stages, their progress was impeded due to an enemy lancer, a Ronin-type, managed to gain control of a chokepoint to 'Rainmaker'. ***FRESH BLOOD*** unable to neglect a challenge to close-combat superiority, decides to singlehandedly deal with the Ronin. But unfortunately, the Ronin seems to be a match, not only for ***FRESH BLOOD*** but also impeding the whole squad.

'Rainmaker' with its arsenal of barrage weaponry served severe damage to the squad. Firing salvo after salvo of missiles into their backline. But fortunately, ***REMELE*** managed to find vulnerabilities within 'Rainmaker's systems and managed to force a reactor meltdown, killing the enemy.

After that, they managed to go towards FOB Saber without impediment.
