# **To my dearest love,**

I don't know if this letter will reach you quickly—or at all—but I need you to know:

## **We're safe.**

It happened this morning. We were gathered at the school when they began evacuating us. The soldiers did their best, but I could tell they were weary. One of them gave Arabella a teddy bear. Their injured that they could carry themselves was put in the bus, I did my best to cover Arabella's eyes.
 
We barely made it two blocks before the engine died then the shooting started. I held Arabella so tight she couldn’t breathe, and I just kept praying that someone—**anyone**—would come.

I didn’t know what they were at first. Just towering shapes through the dust. One of them—tall and silver—walked right up to us, their massive mech lowering itself to check if we were okay. Another one in silver stayed at the front, even when they were being shot at. They didn’t say much over the speakers, but they didn’t need to. One of the kids said they were **"metal angels."** from his favourite show. The name fit. And they got us to the shelter safely.

I had my doubts about this Union, who they were and what they represent. But today they were our saviours.

Arabella’s asleep now. She asked me if you sent them.  

I told her yes.

Come home to us soon.  
We’ll be waiting.

**With all my love,**  
**Komira**
