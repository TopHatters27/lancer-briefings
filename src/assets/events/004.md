# [PERSONAL FIELD ENTRY — SGT. LEANDROS // REDGUNS 3RD SQUAD]  

**DATE**: 26.04.5016u  

Our company lives another die, though that's a stretch. Most of us weren't even soldiers, not really atleast. Half of my squad used to be welders, bricklayers, teachers. One of 'em was washing windows until the Vestans rolled in. Now we're all people with guns in their hands.

Was damn sure we weren't making it out of that canal. Prayers were said, last rites were told. By the time the flare broke through the smoke, I'm sure half the company were ready to meet their maker.

Captain was still up, as if his right arm wasn't busted. Stubborn bastard stood up on that downed tank like it was his personal pedestal. Pistol in his left hand, shouting contacts that we can barely count. Comms Operator mentioned someone buzzing across the channel—choppy signal. Zealot and Primrose. Friendlies. That's what we thought last time and Rael thought the same.

But then I saw it. A small drone, like an overgrown fly, started giving us covering fire. 'Was this it?' I thought, if this was our friendlies.

Then a black figure suddenly leapt from behind buildings and in front of us. Then a few more loomed large, fucking mechs. Lancers.

They didn’t come in quiet. These two hit the open space in front of us shoulder to shoulder, their frames catching rounds meant for us. They didn’t stop to ask who we were or wait for a salute. Just moved—blocking fire with hulls thicker than most bunkers I’ve seen.

And then—hell—this silver one.

One of the cleanest shots I’ve ever seen, mech or man. Moved like he was floating, contacts died one by one, not one wasted bullet. I saw a machine gun position get flattened like God smitted them Himself.

The smoke cleared and we're all still in one piece, 

Captain Rael gave a nod. Didn’t say much. Didn’t have to.

We live another day.
