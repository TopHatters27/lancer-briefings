## **1. SUMMARY**  
At approximately 0815 local orbital time on 25.04.5016u, UNS dropship *Glamdring*, carrying a provisional squadron and diplomatic personnel, came under unexpected hostile fire while conducting a low-orbit descent to Nov Elysia. Visual and signal jamming disrupted navigation and communication. A thermal lance strike disabled *Glamdring*, resulting in a crash-landing in Kirmani Plaza, approximately 16 kilometers from the intended LZ. The diplomatic mission has been deemed compromised.

## **8. CLOSING STATEMENT**  
The ambush and downing of *Glamdring* represents a direct act of war by the Vestan Sovereignty against the Leandric Systems Alliance. The Hullbreakers demonstrated operational resilience in the face of overwhelming disruption and now serve as the only active combat presence on Nov Elysia. Recommend full combat support and reinforcements be mobilized immediately.
