# Mission // #004
## Clear the Air

Communications are down and the Union is scrambling. 1st Lt. Alex Kim has tasked the squad to go to FOB Saber but as the skies litter of Union dropship wrecks, they are re-assigned to take down an array of Anti-Air defences.

# Goals
- Upload netcode to disable jamming array
- Hold satellite dishes from the enemy

# Stakes
- If the mission is failed, the counterattack by allied forces will still have communications jammed leading to loss of life.
