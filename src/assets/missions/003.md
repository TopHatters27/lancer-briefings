# Mission // #003
## Broken Sky

Communications are down and the Union is scrambling. 1st Lt. Alex Kim has tasked the squad to go to FOB Saber but as the skies litter of Union dropship wrecks, they are re-assigned to take down an array of Anti-Air defences.

# Goals
- Neutralize Anti-Air Defences
- Clear Hostile Forces

# Stakes
- If the mission is failed, the operational capacity of the UNS Rio Grande and FOB Saber will be severely limited.

# Reserves
- None at this time.
