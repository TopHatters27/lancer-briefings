As the squad nears FOB Saber, they happen upon the train depot that held the most direct route. Visual scans say that a train car with a mechanized chassis outfitted with missile launchers was in the depot.

Another Union dropship, 'Foehammer', flies overhead ***HULLBREAKER*** and radios in requesting coordinates as they were sent from the UNS Rio Grande to act as reinforcements. Although 'Foehammer' made it further than the first wave did and with no way to pierce through communications jamming, ***HULLBREAKER*** can only watch as they are struck down by a salvo of missiles.

1st Lt. ***ALEX KIM*** through garbled vocal comms and jumbled text messages, re-tasks the squad to destroy enemy Anti-Air defences.
