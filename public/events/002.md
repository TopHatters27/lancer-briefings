The ***HULLBREAKERS*** come upon a beleaguered squadron of LSA troops and a broken down bus filled with civilians.

The squad decides to break established Third-Party protocols by electing to support the battered group. 

***ZEALOT*** repairs the school bus back to basic operational capacity.

A small squad of enemy VS troops evaded ***PRIMROSE***'s scanners and enacted heavy casualties on the convoy.

But due to ***SILVER BULLET***'s non-chalance and cool will, the morale stayed upbeat and the convoy was managed to be escorted into safety.

The LSA troops, grateful for their assistance, managed to give the ***HULLBREAKERS*** an alternate route to FOB Saber.
