8082 the number they gave him after they took him from his family at a young age. He doesn't remember them, assuming they are dead. His life had been nothing but training, turning him into a pilot, a hound. For many years he worked under a handler who seemed immortal, constantly healing from fatal wounds. Silvers bio-tag kept him bound. Escape was impossible.

On one ordinary day, as the handlers back was turned, Jack saw a bullet on the table. Something whispered to him, a cold certainty. He knew it would work. Without hesitation, he picked up the gun, loaded the bullet, and pulled the trigger.

The handler fell to the ground like a hunk of meat, dead.

Jack walked away, leaving his number behind, and took the name Jack Vesper, callsign Silver Bullet. Free, he became a mercenary, living for himself, robbing, drugs, chasing women, easy going with no morals to speak of.
He kept the bullet as a memory, always close, never suspecting that a far more terrifying force held him captive now.
