From an early age, Lysander displayed an uncanny ability at crafting - a gift that began from small projects that steadily grew into something far greater. Where most children idly played, the gears in his mind was at work and his hands built.

In time, his ambitions and ability led him to a peak: a mech frame.

His parents, though scholarly in nature and profession, supported him every step of his journey. His first creations little more than salvaged wrecks. But what they lacked in polish, they made up for in spirit.

Driven by relentless indomitable spirit and a refusal to accept his own limitations, Lysander rebuilt, refined, and reimagined. With each iteration, his designs grew more sophisticated, more powerful, until at last he stood as the architect of a machine truly worthy of his vision.

His skills did not go unnoticed. Offered a place among the mechanized forces of a distant world, Lysander now seeks to prove himself on the grandest stage of all â€” a soldier not of tradition, but of innovation.
