Getting out of your parent's shadow is never an easy task.

A daughter born to one of Union's most decorated fighters - a renowned close-quarters combat specialist armed with legendary mechs and an even more fiery glare - expectations for Abigail were sky-high from the moment she could walk.

But she's nothing like her mother.

The complete polar opposite.

Gentle - Sweet - Approachable

Preferring lines of code over blades of steel. Quiet sabotage over brute force.

Abigail's a technician, a hacker - not a brawler.

Her mother's shadowing looming large and her family name carrying weight than even decorated officers, Abigial struggles with the constant pressure of meeting expectations.

Of those who know her lineage, they scrutinize every single action. Every success compared. Every failure maginified.

As she starts her journey as a Lancer in her own right, Abigial isn't just fighting on the battlefield - she's fighting to define her own identity. Not "her mother's daughter".

Does the apple fall far from the tree?
