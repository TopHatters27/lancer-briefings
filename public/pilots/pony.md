Quincy lived her life as a shut in - spending her days holed up in her room, endlessly scrolling obscure forums, lurking, posting, and doing just enough to keep the lights on in her head. Her parents,senior management of one of the minor corporations along the Cradle, are tired of supporting her lifestyle and decided to kick her into a prestigious Union Academy hoping to turn her into something half-decent. Without consent, Quincy was enrolled into the academy via backrubs and handshakes behind closed doors.

The hopes of having a "real profession" would jumpstart the motivation into her were quickly dashed as Quincy aced classes with ease. Though of that through backroom envelopes or latent potential was up for debate. Now she finds herself piloting heavy machinery she barely cares about, for a world she lacked interest in.

Quincy begrudgingly is here to survive.

And maybe find meaning along the way.
